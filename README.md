# i_am_rich
An app that shows you are rich : )

## About
This app is the result of my studies when developing in Flutter for iOS and Android. It is a very simple app, only to check how Flutter works and it parts of a Flutter course I made.

## Features
* Show the image of a Diamond when the user open the app
* Shows a traditional mantra when the user clicks in the diamond. (TODO)
